behaviorSim_web
===============

This is a web server which creates a gui to connect users to behaviorSim.

The "diagramStudy" branch is specifically for testing the first few sections of the interface which allow users to create a path diagram. This branch treats this functionality as an independent unit and does not link through to the rest of the UI.
