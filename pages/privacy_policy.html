    We might track all kinds of things about how you use this app in order to improve it, but we are committed to protecting your rights. 
    
    Your ip address and email may be collected, but will be kept private and never sold. All other usage data we collect on this website is publicly accessible and may be published. This includes user names, the models you create, and dashboard customizations. Do not do anything here unless you are willing to share it.
    
    We'd love to build better and more secure user accounts, but we'll need more funding. If this is important to you, please contact us and let us know.
