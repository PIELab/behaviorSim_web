            Researchers at the University of South Florida (USF) study many topics. To do this, we need the help of people who agree to take part in a research study. This form tells you about this research study. We are asking you to take part in a research study that is called: behaviorSim Model Builder Usability Assessment The person who is in charge of this research study is Tylar Murray. This person is called the Principal Investigator.

        </p>

        <h4>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h4>
        <p>
            You are being asked to participate because you are interested in modeling and simulation applications to behavioral science. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well our tool enhances users’ ability to describe, share, and simulate dynamical models of human behavior, and also collects information to inform continued development.
        </p>
        <h4>STUDY PROCEDURES</h4>
