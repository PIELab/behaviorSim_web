            IRB Study # Pro00020226
        </p>
        <p>
            Researchers at the University of South Florida (USF) study many topics. To do this, we need the help of people who agree to take part in a research study. This form tells you about this research study. We are asking you to take part in a research study that is called: behaviorSim Model Builder Usability Assessment The person who is in charge of this research study is Tylar Murray. This person is called the Principal Investigator.

            If you consent you will be one of ~40 participants recruited for this study. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits. You are free to discontinue participation at any time without penalty.
        </p>

        <h4>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h4>
        <p>
            You are being asked to participate because you are interested in modeling and simulation applications to behavioral science. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well our tool enhances users’ ability to describe, share, and simulate dynamical models of human behavior, and also collects information to inform continued development.
        </p>
        <h4>STUDY PROCEDURES</h4>
        If you take part in this study, you will be asked to complete:
        <ol>
            <li>Introduction & Consent - this page!</li>
            <li>Demographic Survey - [5min] A few questions on your academic history and interests.</li>
            <li>Software Use - [10-30min] Explore a model using our tool and answer some about it.</li>
            <li>User Experience Survey - [10min] Express your opinions of the tool.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Data will be collected anonymously through your web browser using google forms and cloudant. As with any website you visit, this data may include your public user-agent string and IP address.
