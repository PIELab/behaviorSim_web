        Welcome to behaviorSim v0.1! 
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this project is to help make simulation and modeling tools more accessible to behavioral scientists. This first version explores some of the most basic model-building functionality to standardize our modeling foundation. We want to improve on this prototype before adding more functionality, and we need your feedback to guide us. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If at any point you see something you think needs more work, or if you find something confusing, just hit the "feedback" button in the lower right of the page and follow the prompts. More feedback is better so don't be shy! Just say what you feel. Try this out now and send us a little message about what you think so far.

        This tool is designed to help you draw out "information flow diagrams" to describe your model of how contextual information translates into human behavior. At the end of this exercise you will have a diagram which we will use to compare and contrast your model with others'. 
    </p> 
    <p>
        In this round of testing we would like for you to describe a model of physical activity behavior as measured by a wearable pedometer which yields "step count". All other contextual or behavioral measurements and constructs are up to you!
