        Now we need to <b>draw</b> a path diagram of the model underlying your experiment. We've added all your variables as nodes, but we need to draw arrows (edges) to show how they are connected. Try to imagine how the information "flows" from context nodes towards the behavior nodes. Don't worry too much about <i>how</i> the information from a node affects its connections just yet; we'll do that next.
