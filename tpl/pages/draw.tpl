        We are now going to try to <b>draw</b> a path diagram of the model underlying your experiment. We've added all your variables as nodes, but we need to draw arrows (edges) to show the flow of information between them. Don't worry too much about <i>how</i> the information from a node affects its connections just yet; we'll do that next.
